Any code here was applied/configured for a specific task during my previous work. The name just represents the main function of the codes. 

This folder contains the excel VBA I developed to:
1) lookup value from closed workbook at different locations;
2) automatically sort based on user specified criteria;
3) maintain a database in excel;
4) formatting and exporting;
